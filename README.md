# CONSTRAINT OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM (COPs)


COMBINATORIAL DECISION MAKING AND OPTIMIZATION

VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to the trend of integrating circuits into silicon chips. 
This is necessary to obtain small devices and with much more functionalities.
The problem consists of given axed-width plate and a list of rectangular circuits, decide how to place the circuits on the plate so that the length of the device is minimized.
Itâ€™s necessary develop code to found solution that minimize circuit height. 
Code is developed in python language with z3-solver library in accord with SAT theory (propositional logic).

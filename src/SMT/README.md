Itâ€™s based on First order formalization (FOL), Boolean, domain-specific reasoning.
Respect to SAT, improves expressiveness and scalability.
A given theory expressed in FOL is resolved by SMT solver.
FOL involves propositional symbols, predicates, functions/symbols and quantifiers such that a theory is expressed towards SMT formulas.
In theory a literal is a formula or its negation without connectives and quantifiers.
